# GitHub Practice Questions

1. **When was GitHub first launched, and who were its original founders?**

   \`\`\`
   Founding. Development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon after it had been available for a few months as a beta release.
   \`\`\`

2. **What is a 'pull request' in the context of GitHub, and how is it commonly used?**

   \`\`\`
   Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
   \`\`\`

3. **Can you explain the difference between 'git' and 'GitHub'?**

   \`\`\`
   Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.
   \`\`\`

4. **What is the significance of the 'README.md' file in a GitHub repository?**

   \`\`\`
   README.md files are intended to provide orientation for engineers browsing your code, especially first-time users. The README.md is likely the first file a reader encounters when they browse a directory that contains your code. In this way, it acts as a landing page for the directory.
   \`\`\`

5. **How does GitHub's 'forking' feature work, and what is its primary purpose?**

   \`\`\`
   A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.
   \`\`\`

6. **What is GitHub Actions, and how is it used in software development?**

   \`\`\`
   GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
   \`\`\`

7. **Who acquired GitHub in 2018, and what impact did this acquisition have on the platform?**

   \`\`\`
   Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub has received regulatory approval and is now official. Microsoft announced the completion of its $7.5 billion acquisition of the GitHub hosting and development service on October 26. European Union regulators approved Microsoft's GitHub acquisition on October 19.
   \`\`\`

8. **What is a 'repository' in GitHub, and what are its key components?**

   \`\`\`
   A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public, internal, or private.
   \`\`\`

9. **Explain the concept of 'branching' in GitHub. Why is it important for collaborative projects?**

   \`\`\`
   Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.
   \`\`\`

10. **What is GitHub Pages, and how can it be used to host web pages?**

    \`\`\`
    GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style. This guide will lead you through creating a user site at username.github.io .
