# GitHub Practice Questions

1. **When was GitHub first launched, and who were its original founders?**

   The GitHub service was developed by **Chris Wanstrath**, **P. J. Hyett**, **Tom Preston-Werner**, and **Scott Chacon** using Ruby on Rails, and started in **February 2008**. The company, GitHub, Inc., has existed as of 2007 and is located in San Francisco.

2. **What is a 'pull request' in the context of GitHub, and how is it commonly used?**

   Pull requests are a way to suggest changes to a repository without forcefully changing that repository. In an actual development workflow, someone would be tasked with reviewing that pull request and determining whether or not your code should be accepted.

3. **Can you explain the difference between 'git' and 'GitHub'?**

   The `git` program is different than GitHub, the online service. One of the easiest ways to differentiate the two is to think of _where_ each one "lives."

   - The `git` program "lives" on your computer. You can use the `git` program without being connected to the internet.

   - GitHub is an online service. The majority of GitHub-specific features can only be done on the website.

4. **What is the significance of the 'README.md' file in a GitHub repository?**

   `README.md` files are intended to provide orientation for engineers browsing your code, especially first-time users. The `README.md` is likely the first file a reader encounters when they browse a directory that contains your code. In this way, it acts as a landing page for the directory.


5. **How does GitHub's 'forking' feature work, and what is its primary purpose?**

   A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.

6. **What is GitHub Actions, and how is it used in software development?**

   GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

7. **Who acquired GitHub in 2018, and what impact did this acquisition have on the platform?**

   Github was Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018 and because of it now users can have an unlimited number of repositories.

8. **What is a 'repository' in GitHub, and what are its key components?**

   A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public, internal, or private.

9. **Explain the concept of 'branching' in GitHub. Why is it important for collaborative projects?**
   
   A branch to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.

10. **What is GitHub Pages, and how can it be used to host web pages?**

    GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style.
