# GitHub Practice Questions

1. **When was GitHub first launched, and who were its original founders?**

   \`\`\`
Github was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon.
   \`\`\`


2. **What is a 'pull request' in the context of GitHub, and how is it commonly used?**

   \`\`\`
   Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
   \`\`\`


3. **Can you explain the difference between 'git' and 'GitHub'?**

   \`\`\`
   Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.
   \`\`\`

4. **What is the significance of the 'README.md' file in a GitHub repository?**

   \`\`\`
   README.md files are intended to provide orientation for engineers browsing your code, especially first-time users. The README.md is likely the first file a reader encounters when they browse a directory that contains your code. In this way, it acts as a landing page for the directory.
   \`\`\`

7. **How does GitHub's 'forking' feature work, and what is its primary purpose?**

   \`\`\`
   A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.
   \`\`\`

9. **What is GitHub Actions, and how is it used in software development?**

   \`\`\`
   GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.
   \`\`\`

10. **Who acquired GitHub in 2018, and what impact did this acquisition have on the platform?**

   \`\`\`
   Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. Microsoft is a developer-first company, and by joining forces with GitHub we strengthen our commitment to developer freedom, openness and innovation. The company also said that GitHub will run as an independent unit. Microsoft said the plan was to empower developers as well as bring its tools to new audiences.
   \`\`\`

11. **What is a 'repository' in GitHub, and what are its key components?**

   \`\`\`
   A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
   \`\`\`

12. **Explain the concept of 'branching' in GitHub. Why is it important for collaborative projects?**

   \`\`\`
   Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.
   \`\`\`

11. **What is GitHub Pages, and how can it be used to host web pages?**
