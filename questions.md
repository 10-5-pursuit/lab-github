# GitHub Practice Questions


1. **When was GitHub first launched, and who were its original founders?**

   GitHub was launched on April 10, 2008. Its original founders are Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett.

2. **What is a 'pull request' in the context of GitHub, and how is it commonly used?**

   A 'pull request' is a way to propose changes to a repository. It is commonly used for submitting contributions, bug fixes, or new features. It allows collaborators to review the proposed changes before they are merged into the main branch.

3. **Can you explain the difference between 'git' and 'GitHub'?**

   'Git' is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. 'GitHub' is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git.

4. **What is the significance of the 'README.md' file in a GitHub repository?**

   The 'README.md' file serves as documentation for a GitHub repository. It typically contains information about the project, instructions on how to use it, and any relevant details for contributors or users.

5. **How does GitHub's 'forking' feature work, and what is its primary purpose?**

   'Forking' in GitHub allows users to create a personal copy of someone else's project. The primary purpose is to encourage collaboration and contributions by allowing users to make changes in their forked copy without affecting the original repository. Users can then propose these changes back to the original project through pull requests.

6. **What is GitHub Actions, and how is it used in software development?**

   GitHub Actions is an automation tool integrated into GitHub for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. It automates tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software directly from the GitHub repository.

7. **Who acquired GitHub in 2018, and what impact did this acquisition have on the platform?**

   Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. The acquisition led to improvements in GitHub's infrastructure, features, and integration with Microsoft's development tools, while still maintaining GitHub's independence.

8. **What is a 'repository' in GitHub, and what are its key components?**

   A 'repository' in GitHub is a location where a project's files and version history are stored. Key components include the project's files, commit history, branches, issues, and pull requests.

9. **Explain the concept of 'branching' in GitHub. Why is it important for collaborative projects?**

   'Branching' in GitHub involves creating a separate line of development for a specific feature or bug fix. It is important for collaborative projects as it allows multiple contributors to work on different features simultaneously without affecting the main codebase. Branches can later be merged into the main branch.

10. **What is GitHub Pages, and how can it be used to host web pages?**

    GitHub Pages is a feature that allows users to host static websites directly from their GitHub repositories. It simplifies the process of publishing web pages by automatically building and deploying the content whenever changes are made to the repository.
