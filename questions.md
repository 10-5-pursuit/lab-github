# GitHub Practice Questions

1. **When was GitHub first launched, and who were its original founders?**
The site was launched in April 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, P. J. Hyett and Scott Chacon

2. **What is a 'pull request' in the context of GitHub, and how is it commonly used?**
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
  

3. **Can you explain the difference between 'git' and 'GitHub'?**

   Git is a version local control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a remote web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.

4. **What is the significance of the 'README.md' file in a GitHub repository?**

   Guidelines. README.md files are intended to provide orientation for engineers browsing your code, especially first-time users. The README.md is likely the first file a reader encounters when they browse a directory that contains your code. In this way, it acts as a landing page for the directory.

5. **How does GitHub's 'forking' feature work, and what is its primary purpose?**

   A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository.

6. **What is GitHub Actions, and how is it used in software development?**

 GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

7. **Who acquired GitHub in 2018, and what impact did this acquisition have on the platform?**

   Acquired by Microsoft, one of the biggest changes has been a major shift around how GitHub handles private repositories. In the past, free users had a limited number of repositories and needed to shift to a Pro subscription if they wanted more.

8. **What is a 'repository' in GitHub, and what are its key components?**

  A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It's a place where you can store your code, your files, and each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

9. **Explain the concept of 'branching' in GitHub. Why is it important for collaborative projects?**

  Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a new branch from the default branch of your repository.

10. **What is GitHub Pages, and how can it be used to host web pages?**

   Using GitHub Pages, you can create a website by simply publishing static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files from GitHub's repository. Among the many benefits of the GitHub web hosting service, a few of the main ones are how simple and easy it is to use.
