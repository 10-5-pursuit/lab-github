# GitHub Practice Questions

1. **When was GitHub first launched, and who were its original founders?**

   \`\`\`
   2008; Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett
   \`\`\`

2. **What is a 'pull request' in the context of GitHub, and how is it commonly used?**

   \`\`\`
   A 'pull request' is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. It's commonly used amongst collaborators to review and discuss potential changes.  It's imperative to use this feature when working on a group project because it puts measures in place to prevent teammates from merging unintentional changes to the main/base code/program.

3. **Can you explain the difference between 'git' and 'GitHub'?**

   \`\`\`
   'git' is a free, high-quality distributed version control system (VCS) suitable for tracking modifications in source code in software development.  git is local, github is remote. 
 'Github' is a web-based Git repository. This hosting service has cloud-based storage and offers all distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git while adding its own features. It makes it easier to collaborate using Git. 

Additionally, GitHub repositories are open to the public. Developers worldwide can interact and contribute to one another’s code, modify or improve it, making GitHub a networking site for web professionals. The process of interaction and contribution is also called social coding.

4. **What is the significance of the 'README.md' file in a GitHub repository?**

   \`\`\`
   'README.md' are Markdown files that describe a directory.  It acts as a landing page for the directory.  They are intended to provide orientation for engineers browsing your code, especially first-time users.  It provides context, explains functionality, facilitates setup, offers instructions, share important resources, and promotes collaboration.
   \`\`\`

6. **How does GitHub's 'forking' feature work, and what is its primary purpose?**

   \`\`\`
   Github's 'forking' feature allows us to create a copy of the document.  It's primary purpose is to propose changes to the upstream repository. 
   \`\`\`

8. **What is GitHub Actions, and how is it used in software development?**

   \`\`\`
   GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.  You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.  An action is a custom application for the GitHub Actions platform that performs a complex but frequently repeated task.  Use an action to help reduce the amount of repetitive code that you write in your workflow files.  An action can pull your git repository from GitHub, set up the correct toolchain for your build environment, or set up the authentication to your cloud provider.  You can write your own actions, or you can find actions to use in your workflows in the GitHub Marketplace.

10. **Who acquired GitHub in 2018, and what impact did this acquisition have on the platform?**

   \`\`\`
   Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018 for $7.5 billion in Microsoft stock.  This impacts the platforms tools such as project 'Paper Cut' which they hopes will help address some of the gripes that its developer-users might have with how GitHub works that the company itself hadn’t been planning to address in bigger product upgrades. The idea here is that GitHub can either help find workarounds, or this will become a feedback forum of its own to help figure out what it should be upgrading next on the site.  Their main focus seems to be on customer retention by showing itself as a OpenSource supporter - "Previously anything MS was considered as commercial license but lately MS has opened up itself with a lot of technologies(like TypeScript), tools(like VSCode editor) and this is a bigger move to show their support and also embrace the technology that might become an option in the enterprise versions of code management."

11. **What is a 'repository' in GitHub, and what are its key components?**

   \`\`\`
   A repository is a place where you can store your code, files, and each file's revision history.  Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private. 
   \`\`\`

11. **Explain the concept of 'branching' in GitHub. Why is it important for collaborative projects?**

   \`\`\`
   \`\`\`

11. **What is GitHub Pages, and how can it be used to host web pages?**
