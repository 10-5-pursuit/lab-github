# GitHub Practice Questions

1. **When was GitHub first launched, and who were its original founders?**

   \`\`\` 
   GitHub, initiated on April 10, 2008, was established by Chris Wanstrath, PJ Hyett, Tom Preston-Werner, and Scott Chacon. 
   \`\`\`

2. **What is a 'pull request' in the context of GitHub, and how is it commonly used?**

   \`\`\`A pull request (PR) is a formal way of suggesting modifications to a codebase hosted on GitHub, allowing developers ro submit changes they've made in their own copies/branches.
   Other team members can provide feedback, and once approved, the changes are merged.
   \`\`\`

3. **Can you explain the difference between 'git' and 'GitHub'?**

   \`\`\` Git is the version control system itself, providing the core functionality for tracking changes in code. GitHub is a hosting platform built around Git, allowing for additional collaboration features and providing a centralized place for hosting and managing Git repositories.
   
    While Git is used locally on a developer's machine(computer), GitHub is a web-based platform accessible by anyone involved in a software project.

4. **What is the significance of the 'README.md' file in a GitHub repository?**

   \`\`\`Basically the README.md file acts as the starting point for anyone enagaging with the repository. It enhances the repository's accessibility, helping users and contributors understand the purpose, functionality, and guidelines related to the project by giving clear and concise context, sorta like a prerequsite.
   \`\`\`

5. **How does GitHub's 'forking' feature work, and what is its primary purpose?**

   \`\`\`The forking feature enables collaborative development by allowing users to create personal copies / "forks" of repositories.
    Users can make changes in their forked repositories without affecting the original project.
    Forking facilitates a structured workflow, ensuring that contributors can experiment, make improvements, and contribute code changes to projects while maintaining the integrity of the original
   \`\`\`

6. **What is GitHub Actions, and how is it used in software development?**

   \`\`\`Github actions automates various tasks, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy their code directly within the GitHub repository. 
   the actions consist of 
   Builds, Testing, Deployment,Code Analysis, Notifications,
   \`\`\`

7. **Who acquired GitHub in 2018, and what impact did this acquisition have on the platform?**

   \`\`\`Since Microsoft took over GitHub in 2018, they've brought updates. They added new features, made things run smoother, and upgraded GitHub with more tools and services. The idea is to make GitHub more accesible whether you're a solo developer, part of a team, or working in a big company. 
   \`\`\`

8. **What is a 'repository' in GitHub, and what are its key components?**

   \`\`\`A central space where your project and its files are stored. It serves as a version-controlled directory, allowing you to manage and track changes to your code.
   \`\`\`

9. **Explain the concept of 'branching' in GitHub. Why is it important for collaborative projects?**

   \`\`\`Branches are separate lines of development within a repository. They allow you to work on features or bug fixes independently without affecting the main codebase. The default branch is often named 'main' or 'master.'
   \`\`\`

10. **What is GitHub Pages, and how can it be used to host web pages?**

    \`\`\`GitHub Pages is a web hosting service provided by GitHub that allows users to publish static web pages directly from their GitHub repositories. It is a convenient and straightforward way to showcase projects, documentation, portfolios, or any other content in a website format.
